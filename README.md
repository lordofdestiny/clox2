# clox2

This project is an implementation of a programing language, inspiration for which was taken from Bobert Nystrom's book ["Crafting Interpreters"](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).
The language shares the basic sytax with the Lox programming language Bob invented for his book, but is extended in 
syntax in features I have deemed useful or interesting. Currenlty, the language doesn't have a name, even though the repository
references it's inspiration. The language is still a work in progress and is in a process of gaining it's own identiy.
